			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Pseudocode the major steps of an everyday task and a simple game, with the latter being comments in javascript. Upload the results of both of these to our GitHub website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I accidentally commented out the javscript code after moving it into the index.html file, and it didn't appear on the website. After realizing that's what happened, it only took a few seconds to fix and get working properly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was an introduction to problem-solving and pseudocoding, both of which I am already pretty familiar with, so it wasn't a difficult assignment and went by pretty quickly. It's a nice feeling to see myself getting more familiar with HTML and CSS over just a few weeks of this class, and it's looking promising that I won't be having much trouble with either of them by the time we get into learning javascript.</p>
