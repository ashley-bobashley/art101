//Create the variables rock, paper, and scissors
//Choose 1 randomly
//Let user input their choice between rock, paper, or scissors
//Compare the two variables
	//If values are the same, print both players’ choices and the text “It’s a tie!”, then the computer and player both choose again
	//If values are different, then:
		//If player has rock:
			//If computer has scissors: print both players’ choices and the text “You Win!”
			//If computer has paper: print both players’ choices and the text “You Lose!”
		//If player has scissors:
			//If computer has paper: print both players’ choices and the text “You Win!”
			//If computer has rock: print both players’ choices and the text “You Lose!”
		//If player has paper:
			//If computer has rock: print both players’ choices and the text “You Win!”
			//If computer has scissors: print both players’ choices and the text “You Lose!”
