			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't run into any problems with this lab, the directions were easy to follow along to.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I already have familiarity with functions from my previous coding experience, and they work pretty much the same in JavaScript. The process to convert a string is very different (doesn't require a manual for loop), and the sort function is more janky.</p>
